# OpenGL

This is my journey to learn OpenGL. I have followed the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials.

## Getting Started

In this part i have started from creating a window to leaning about basic shaders and implementing texture, trasformation and camera systems. Final result can be seen in the following gif.
